This project is my DECO1400 final assignment on website development.

The website i have decided to make, is a short story forum where users
can read, write and review short stories. My platform also serves as a
learning environment where writers can hone their writing abilities and
gain feedback. 

The main goal of this website is to practice my html/css/javascript and
any design concepts i have learnt in my curriculum.
